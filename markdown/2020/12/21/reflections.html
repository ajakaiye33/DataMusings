<h2 id="introduction">
<a class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hey there, yes you and everyone that have taken out time to read my blog or ‘blabbing page’ this year, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart! There is no doubt that this year, ‘the year of the corona-virus’, has been quite tough and challenging. Not only was our social-economic life disrupted,according to the World Health Organization,as at the time of writing, over 1.7 million people have died from covid-19 complications.</p>

<p>Obviously, a greater part of the year was inundated with the gloom and doom of the coronavirus, but in the midst of these dark episodes, there were occasional flashes of light, warmth and hope here and there. I had my own flashes. Hope you had yours. Today’s post will be more or less a review of my struggles and achievements in the year of the coronavirus!</p>

<p>To do justice to this topic, I have decided to discuss my trumps and triumphs under the following subheadings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Books read
    <ul>
      <li>Technical Books</li>
      <li>Non-Technical Books</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Science Projects</li>
  <li>Volunteer Work</li>
  <li>Blog Posts</li>
  <li>Certifications and Exams</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="certification-and-exams">
<a class="anchor" href="#certification-and-exams" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Certification and Exams</h2>

<p>I’m proud to say that being certified as an AWS cloud Practioner was one of the positive moments of the year 2020. As a matter of fact, the certification was one of my first achievements of the year. I sat for the exam on the 23rd of January 2020 and after barely 24 hours received an email from AWS through Certmetrics saying:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You will agree with me that the timing between when I received notice of my results and the subsequent onslaught of the coronavirus was quite creepy and inauspicious because less than two weeks, the infamous total ‘shutdowns’ started owing to the spread of the covid19 virus. No thanks to covid-19, I never had the opportunity to celebrate and take myself out for a drink at the pubs. The experience that humanity was undergoing was depicted in a Pinterest Parody post which showed humans taking the place of the animals in the zoo and like a role reverse scenario, the animals roaming freely on our empty streets and parks!</p>

<p>As a survivalist strategy, I decided to put my hands and mind to work as a means of coping with the apparent boredom.
To this end, I started getting my hands dirty with data science projects.</p>

<h2 id="data-science-projects">
<a class="anchor" href="#data-science-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Science Projects</h2>
<p>My first project was a personal attempt to make sense of my country’s data on the covid-19 virus. I started with recording and tracking on daily bases reports on the numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations and recoveries as I could not find a time series format data sets with these variables for the different states of the country.
Fortunately, I was lucky to come across a website that had the data set I needed. So I wrote a small python script to extract and pipe the data to my app, which updates automatically with no manual intervention in any way.</p>

<p>I wanted to display my Exploratory Data Analysis, visualizations and predictive modelling skills to the World. This desires led me to <a href="'https://www.streamlit.io/'">streamlit </a> platform. With streamlit, I was able to turn my jupyter notebook to a dashboard! I personally love streamlit, and I strongly suggest you try it out if you have not.</p>

<p>Through streamlit, I put together a dashboard with varied visualizations and also implemented with <a href="'https://pypi.org/project/prophet/'">Prophet</a> a forecasting model to predict the growth and plateau of confirmed covid-19 cases. To host my streamlit app so that it will be available to everyone in the world, I turned to <a href="'https://www.heroku.com/'">Heroku</a>. Heroku made deployment easy and intuitive! Although still under active building process you can see the deployed version of the app <a href="'https://covid-streamlit-app.herokuapp.com/'">here</a></p>

<p>My second project was a capstone project for my diploma degree in Data Science and Analytics from the University of Petroleum Energy India. Of course, it was a virtual program which took around six months to complete. The live lectures were conducted via zoom and GoToMeeting apps. We were given five topics and dataset. The capstone is expected to be carried out on one area or topic. I chose the topic which required building a predictive model to detect and prevent energy theft, i.e. Electricity Theft. My mentor was a thorough and fantastic dude. With his guide, I was able to build two models: Regression model version and Classification model version. The most import take away from this project for me was the new skills I learned through my mentor on how to handle and detect outliers in machine learning projects. You can see the completed version of the project <a href="'https://github.com/ajakaiye33/Energy-Theft-Prediction/tree/master'">here</a></p>

<h2 id="books-read">
<a class="anchor" href="#books-read" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Books Read</h2>
<h3 id="technical-books">
<a class="anchor" href="#technical-books" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Books</h3>
<p>I studied three books on data science, data handling and python.
<strong>Python Projects For Beginners</strong>, by <em>Connor P. Milliken</em>
I really love the ten weeks Journey this book took me through! The author structured the book in such a way that every day of the ten weeks is filled with one activity or another and at the end of the week, a mini-project covering contents and terms studied in prior weekdays is given to the student. I took away a lot of new approach to using the python language for data handling and visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>Python Feature Engineering Cookbook</strong> by <em>Soledad Galli</em>
This is one of my favourite read for the Year. Although I have read it cover to cover but often time I refer to it now and then. The book is a good read, especially if you are new to the craft of Feature Engineering. Above all, I like the author’s procedures which she documented as a veritable optional package to scikit-learn concerning feature engineering.</p>

<p><strong>The Data Wrangling Workshop</strong> by *Brian Lipp et al *
This is one of the best technical books I have studied in a long time. This book will blow your socks off if your desire is learning to handle messy data with python. It contains a ton of tricks and gems on data handling.</p>

<h3 id="non-technical-books">
<a class="anchor" href="#non-technical-books" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Non-Technical Books</h3>
<p>You may be wondering after all the time on projects and technical books, how do I have time for ‘leisure reading’? You are probably right, my plate was quite full, but the drive to kill boredom and avoid my ‘mind turning into devils workshop’ turned me into a voracious reader.</p>

<p><strong>Supper Thinking, The Big Book of Mental Models</strong> by <em>Gabriel Weinberg</em>
This book is a classic. I have the ebook and audio versions. I actually was amongst the first few that purchased it when it came out. I bought it because I read a blog post done by the same author and was totally sold! I read it with so much intensity that I made out over 50 A4 size pages of notes and mind maps. It is a book that will turn you into a walking problem solver. After reading this book, I can say comfortably that the tendency to make an error judgement call on policies and issues, in general, has reduced to bearest minimum.</p>

<h2 id="technical-blog">
<a class="anchor" href="#technical-blog" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Blog</h2>
<p>This is one of the scariest things I did in the Year. Scarest because I faced my fears and demons. I read somewhere that one doesn’t truly know something until he teaches that thing to someone else. I started this blog as a way to document my thoughts processes as I learn the art and craft of Data Science and transition from Trade Analyst to a Data Scientist.
I have always wanted to set up a blog, but the numerous hoops and obstacles a newbie was expected to jump and walk-around discouraged me. However, I overcame this hurdle when I encountered Mr Jeremy, one of the founders of fast ai platform. Jeremy and his fantastic team put together a fast pages project which magically turned normal jupyter notebook and medium file into a blog post with all the trappings of a normal website. This discovery was a big relief because all I needed was a code editor to write my medium files-just like this post, which I’m writing with atom’s editor or a jupyter notebook and a GitHub account. I push the files to GitHub, and voila I get back a beautiful laid out blog post!!</p>

<h2 id="volunteerism">
<a class="anchor" href="#volunteerism" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Volunteerism</h2>
<p>This is one area that I foresee myself doing more in the coming year. Volunteerism is all about using my acquired skills to solve problems in the non-for-profit space and other data science-related organizations. I contributed my quota as a volunteer worker in this years DATA NATIVE CONFERENCE. Data Native is a media platform which showcases individuals and organizations doing something worthwhile in the data science space. I had a lot of fun, and I meet a lot of smart people in the field of Data Science and Data Engineering. I particularly learned the logistics and planning that goes into putting together a world-class Data Science Conference. I look forward to next years conference even though this year’s conference was virtual.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">
<a class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope I did not bore you with my shameless ‘self-gratifying’ stories of my struggles in the year of the coronavirus. I have read books built data science projects started my AWS certification journey, volunteered and applied my skill to solve real-life problems and started a blog post where I share with you my learning journey and wow moments. I hope you have learned something today.
Bye!!</p>
