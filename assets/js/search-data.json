            "content": "How Pandas’s read_excel Saved My Life . . Introduction . As common amongst the majority of individuals under the category of Data Scientist by Accident, once in a while, you come across what I call ‘moments of enlightenment’ which more or less upgrade your knowledge about the ‘tools of the trade’. I encountered one of such moments a couple of days ago. And since I just set up a new blog courtesy of fastai, I decided to relay my experience on how I entered Zen from discovering the usefulness and existence of pandas’s read_html methods! . Data in the Data Science Process . I make bold to say that the entire Data Science process revolves around one main resource: DATA. Data is an essential raw material in the manufacturing of Data Visualization Models. While drawing on the analogy to drive home my point about data and its importance in the data Science pipeline, I’m very much aware that we don’t literally manufacture anything rather a methodical transformation of inputs takes place. Thus raw data as an input is transformed into an output format that solves one problem or needs in the society. No doubt data is very important in the data Science process, but how do we go about getting this data into our data science work environment? . Getting Data into Jupyter Notebook . Before encountering Data Science, all I know about data and its handling was tied to one tool: MS EXCEL. Excel is an excellent tool in it own right but there come a time in your data handling experience when excel won’t just cut it. Most of my challenges with excel started manifesting when my data became larger. Lucky for me after narrating my challenges on stackoverflow and exposing myself to public ridicule from some not-too-kind responders, I went away with the knowledge of the existence of PANDAS and JUPYTER NOTEBOOK. Of course, with these new set of tools, I became the go-to-guy in the office for any data wrangling exercise and functions. Majority of the data I use comes from scraping them off websites pages and transforming the data into csv format which I then read into the jupyter notbook for onward processing, exploration and analysis. Aside from the pandas’s read_csv method I knew from reading the documentation I could use read_json, read_table, read_html e.t.c to load data unto jupyter notbook but never attempted using them until recently when I attended an online workshop, and the facilitator used the pandas’s read_html method. . ### Can Life be this fun and Easy? My excitement knew no bounds when it occurred to me that I can improve productivity levels by just reading and loading data directly from websites pages especially when the data I’m interested in are housed within html’s table tags. For example, to scrape this site normally, I will write the following code: . def get_site_html(url): try: html = requests.get(url) except HTTPError as e: return None try: bs = BeautifulSoup(html.content, &#39;html.parser&#39;) title = bs except AttributeError as e: return None return title def get_data(): site_html = get_site_html(&#39;https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/&#39;) the_table = site_html.find(&#39;table&#39;, {&#39;id&#39;: &#39;custom1&#39;}) head_table = the_table.thead.get_text().split(&#39; n&#39;)[2:6] # print(the_table) body_table = the_table.find_all(&#39;tr&#39;) table_head = body_table[0] # print(table_head) table_row = body_table[1:] # print(table_row) headings = [ht.get_text() for ht in table_head.find_all(&#39;th&#39;)] # print(headings) gey = [] all_rows = [table_row[i].find_all(&#39;td&#39;) for i in range(len(table_row))] for j in all_rows: one_row = [] for h in j: one_row.append(h.get_text().replace(&#39; n&#39;, &#39;&#39;)) gey.append(one_row) df = pd.DataFrame(data=gey, columns=headings) return df . As much as I suspect the above sample code code be more concise, with pandas read_html method I can achieve the same purpose with just these few lines: . import pandas as pd data = pd.read_html(&#39;https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/&#39;) data.head() . I bet you can’t get more concise than that. These few lines have saved me alot of time and boosted my productivity to the roof. Hope you learnt a thing or two from this post. Watch out for my next post. Bye! .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
